AstroCalc4R

R and C software for calculating solar zenith angles; time at sunrise, local noon and sunset; and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) based on date, time and location

AstroCalc4R can be used to compute variables related to solar illuminance at the surface of the earth or ocean. These variables are useful in studying diel effects on biota and in calculating solar energy inputs for ecosystem studies. The software was developed for use with data from NEFSC bottom trawl survey in the Northwest Atlantic but can also be used for aquatic and terrestrial systems.
